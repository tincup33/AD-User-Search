I originally created this script to help make my forensic investigations a little easier.
I have developed it a little more so that it can also be useful to me as I conduct hunts.

The script will return basic user information but also group ownership and group membership details.
I have included a numbered list in the event that multiple users are found so you can just pick the number next to the user to view the info.
This script will accept partial information in order to return a list. (ex. Jam can be used to find James, Jamie, JAmbrose as a username, etc.)
